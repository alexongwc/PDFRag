# SG Road traffic chat bot 

As a road user in Singapore, being aware of the Road Traffic Act 1961 and the various offences and penalties it outlines is crucial for safe and lawful driving.

Imagine you're driving and you unknowingly commit an offence. You might wonder, "What penalties could I face under the Road Traffic Act?" This chatbot project aims to help users like you get answers in a more human and relatable way.

Instead of just listing legal jargon or penalties, the bot could respond with something like:

Bot Response Example:

"Hey there! Based on the Road Traffic Act 1961, if you were caught speeding above 20 km/h over the limit, you might be facing a fine or even demerit points. Remember, it's not just about avoiding penaltiesâ€”safe driving protects you and everyone else on the road. Let me know if you have any other questions or if you're curious about different traffic rules!"

This  bridges the gap between dense legal text and everyday understanding. It transforms complex legal documents into accessible and practical advice, helping road users stay informed and compliant with traffic laws
