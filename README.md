# SG Road traffic chat bot 

As a road user in Singapore, being aware of the Road Traffic Act 1961 and the various offences and penalties it outlines is crucial for safe and lawful driving.

A problem with LLM is that they often hallucinate on things they don`t know about, producing unrealiable results. 

If we train the LLM on the documents that we want it to learn, the LLM would be able to 
retrieve from the documents its trained on, augment and generate answer thats relevent to the prompt. 
The Retrieve Augment Generate(RAG) bot would only be able to answer questions that its been trained on. 

There are alot more things we can do with LLM RAG, 
we can train the model to Rank the documents,  
data driven prediction and real time analysis ,
up to date or domain specific(Legal document, scientific paper) information retrieval.
